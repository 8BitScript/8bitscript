Named systems live in three layers — advertised in 8bitscript.config.ts, this clone's .8bitscript/systems.json, and ~/.config/8bitscript/systems.json — and `8bs run --system` / `build` / `boot` resolve through that merge. `--checkout` (or EIGHTBITSCRIPT_CHECKOUT / toolchain.json) points a consumer at a local 8BitScript tree without rewriting its package.json. The editor's side bar has one Update/Install for that tree (workspace repo, or a clone under the extension's global storage) plus named-system quick launch; Configure System and Show Project are editor tabs.

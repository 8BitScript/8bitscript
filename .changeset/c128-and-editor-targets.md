The C128 builds and runs, and the editor offers every machine that does.

The C128 is the C64 again in almost every respect that matters here, which is why it went quickly: the same VIC-II registers and the same frame as an exact fraction of the same crystal (`FRAME_SYNC` already recorded the two entries identically), a screen at `$0400` written through a computed address, and a character ROM whose mixed-case set holds lower case at 1-26 and upper case at 65-90 — measured against `chargen-390059-01.bin`, where code 8 is `h` and code 72 is `H`, with only 105 and 122 differing across the block-graphics range, exactly as on every other Commodore here.

Three things are its own. Its `.prg` loads at `$1C01` and its RAM ends at `$C000` — 41983 bytes, which is what `packages/c128/AGENTS.md` has always recorded, and the catalog's new build symbols reproduce that number exactly. Its zero page starts at `$0A`: `$00`/`$01` are the 8502's port and `$02`-`$09` are the KERNAL's JMPFAR/JSRFAR parameters, so those nine bytes stay the machine's — which is not a new decision, but the one this project's own pre-0.2.0 C128 link map already made. And its text package now selects the mixed-case set, which on this machine means agreeing with the ROM rather than overriding it: the C128 boots that way.

Measured under x128: hello-world is **225 bytes** and returns to a working `ready.` prompt; 2048 is **3583 bytes** and draws its board.

`@8bitscript/c128/text` also gets the fix its siblings got: it mapped only 64-95 and left lower case at 97-122, which in the upper-case set are graphics symbols.

The VS Code extension offers `pet`, `c64`, `vic20`, `c128` and `web` — its task-definition enum, its system setting, and the launcher's own list. What each machine *offers* was never listed there and still is not: every option, value and preset comes from `8bs targets --json`, so the C64's REU sizes and the VIC-20's RAM expansions arrived on their own the moment those machines were on the list.

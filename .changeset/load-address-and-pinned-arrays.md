Groundwork for the second 6502 machine: the backend stops assuming it is building for the PET.

Three things that were the PET's are now the hardware sheet's or the machine's:

- **The load address comes off the sheet.** It was a per-machine table in `mos/index.ts`, which the VIC-20 disproves — a RAM expansion moves BASIC's program area from `$1001` to `$1201`, so one machine has two. It is `build.defsym.__load_address` now, alongside `__ram_size`, and a catalog can carry machine-level build symbols (`"8bitscript".hardware.build`) rather than only per-option ones. A machine whose sheet lacks one is refused by name.
- **Zero-page budgets are per machine.** `ZP_BUDGETS` pairs the polite budget (a program that returns to BASIC) with the owned one (a program that never does). The C64's polite range is nothing like the PET's: BASIC owns `$02-$8F` and the KERNAL `$90-$FF`, leaving `$FB-$FE` — four bytes, enough to print and return and nothing like enough for real state, which is the same trade the PET's own two budgets make.
- **`@address` arrays lower.** They were refused by name; they now bind their label to the pinned address through a new `equate` directive in the assembler, so an `@address` array reaches hardware by exactly the path a data-section array reaches the program image by, and emits no bytes. This is what the C64 and VIC-20 packages are written against — `screenRam[cell] = 32` over the VIC's screen — 65 uses across the two.

The PET is byte-for-byte unchanged by all of it (hello-world 108/108/127 across the 2001, 3032 and 8032; 2048 2440 bytes on a stock 4K 2001).

The C64 is deliberately **not** added to `RELEASE_MACHINES` yet: a package's own emulator tests switch on from that list, so listing a machine before it can build a program runs them against one that cannot boot what they load. It joins when it builds. The next blocker is `asm6502` blocks, which reach the backend as raw text and need a 6502 assembly parser; `setupVideo()` in `@8bitscript/c64` uses them to bank the KERNAL out.

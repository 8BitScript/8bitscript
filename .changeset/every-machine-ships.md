Every machine the toolchain knows now builds and runs. `RELEASE_MACHINES` is the whole list.

The NES and the Atari 8-bit join, each brought up against its own emulator — `Hello World!` and 2048 seen on screen under `fceux` and `atari800`. Neither fits the shape every machine before them shared (a `.prg` with a BASIC stub that `SYS`es in and `RTS`es back), which is what `mos/image.ts` exists for: a NES program is a ROM started by a reset vector, an Atari program is a segmented `.xex` the DOS loader jumps through.

**The X16's zero page widens from 94 bytes to 181**, and 2048 fits it. The evidence is the ROM's own ld65 configuration rather than the docs' summary table: `cfg/x16.cfginc` declares ZPKERNAL at `$80`, ZPDOS at `$91`, ZPAUDIO at `$A7`, ZPMATH at `$A9` and ZPBASIC at `$D4`, and `cfg/kernal-x16.cfgtpl` loads every one of the KERNAL bank's four zero-page segments into ZPKERNAL while no other bank declares zero page at all — so no KERNAL routine can reach `$A9`-`$FF`, whatever it is asked to do. That range is the Math library's and BASIC's, and the reference manual releases both to machine code outright. A program that never hands BASIC back takes it; one that does keeps the polite `$22`-`$7F`.

`$02`-`$21` stays out under both, though 2048 would fit inside the old ceiling if it were taken: those are `r0`-`r15`, the KERNAL API's caller-supplied 16-bit argument registers, demonstrably written through `extapi`, and "does this program call such a routine" is not a fact readable off the finished instruction stream the way `usesWaitFrame` is — the calls sit inside opaque `asm6502` blocks.

A zero-page budget may now carry holes of its own, and they survive into every program. The PET's CHRGET hole is the other kind — it exists only because a returning program leaves BASIC's interpreter running — and still drops for a program that never returns.

The VS Code extension offers all nine targets. What each machine *offers* is still never listed there: every option, value and preset comes from `8bs targets --json`.

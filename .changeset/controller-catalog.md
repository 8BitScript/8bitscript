Each machine's hardware catalog now says what a controller **carries**, not just how many ports it has — and a controller's *kind* is derived from that list rather than written down beside it.

`input.joysticks: 2` and `input.pads: 2` count ports. They cannot be projected onto a real control list, because two machines with two pad ports each can take entirely different pads: the NES's eight bits and the X16's twelve are both "2". So the editor's Controller Setup panel kept two tables of its own — what each kind of device carries, and which pad each machine takes — and its own comment said it should not have to. Those tables are gone.

**The new fact is `input.controls`**: the logical controls, in 8BitScript's own names, that the controller on this machine's ports actually carries.

| machine | declares | derived kind |
|---|---|---|
| PET | — | none |
| VIC-20 | `up down left right a` | `atari-stick` |
| C64 | `up down left right a` | `atari-stick` |
| C128 | `up down left right a` | `atari-stick` |
| Atari 8-bit | `up down left right a` | `atari-stick` |
| MEGA65 | `up down left right a` | `atari-stick` |
| NES | `a b select start up down left right` | `nes-pad` |
| Commander X16 | `up down left right a b x y l r start select` | `snes-pad` |
| web | — | none |

Every row is the repository's own research, not recall. `packages/c64/src/joystick.8bs` declares `Joystick.UP`/`DOWN`/`LEFT`/`RIGHT`/`FIRE` — five switches shorting to ground, the whole of the nine-pin Atari standard; `packages/vic20/AGENTS.md` traces the VIC-20's same five lines across two VIAs (right is VIA2 port B bit 7, a keyboard-column line); `packages/atari8/AGENTS.md` records that the Atari's own masks are bit for bit the C64's with `JOY_BTN_1_MASK` the only button, which is why `@8bitscript/atari8/joystick` can export the same values without either machine being fudged; `packages/c128/AGENTS.md` and `packages/mega65/AGENTS.md` both say CIA1 as the C64's. `packages/nes/src/pad.8bs` names the shift register's fixed order — A, B, SELECT, START, UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT — and the catalog lists them in that order for that reason. The one button on a stick is `a` rather than `b`: it is the only button the machine has, and `a` is the one control every wider shape has in common.

**The X16 is the machine this branch could not fully establish.** `packages/cx16/AGENTS.md` settles that it has two SNES pad ports (and that the KERNAL's reader for them is confusingly called `joystick_get`, `$FF56`). The twelve controls are the SNES pad's own set. What this repository does *not* carry is the bit layout `joystick_get` returns, and nothing here invents one — `packages/cx16/src/input.8bs` is still an honest stub that reads neither the pads nor the keyboard. The catalog says what the ports hold; it does not yet say what order the bits arrive in.

**A kind is derived, never declared.** Nothing in a catalog spells `nes-pad`. `CONTROLLER_KINDS` in `packages/compiler/src/fold/facts.mjs` names four shapes and the exact set of controls each one is — `atari-stick` (5), `nes-pad` (8), `snes-pad` (12), `xbox-style` (all 18) — and `controllerKind(controls)` matches a machine's list against them. A name stored beside the shape it names is two statements that can disagree, and the one that can be checked would lose to the one that cannot. It also means a machine added tomorrow whose controller happens to be an Atari stick is recognised as one without a line of code changing at either end, which is the point. Matching is exact set equality rather than a subset ladder: a two-button stick clears the bar for `a` and `b` and is still not an NES pad, and a shape that matches nothing is `null` rather than the nearest guess.

`xbox-style` is in the table and no machine carries it. It is the shape of the *host* pad this project develops against — the 8BitDo SN30 Pro in X-input mode that `docs/project/input.md` names as the development standard — and it is the superset the other three are projected out of, so naming it costs nothing and leaves the ladder complete.

**Where it lives in a catalog matters.** The Commodores declare it on the `joystick` *value* of `port1`/`port2`, because on those machines what is in the port is a choice: `--hardware port1=none,port2=none` really does resolve to no controls, and the panel says so instead of drawing five controls onto an empty port. It is deliberately *absent* from `none`, `paddles` and `mouse1351` rather than empty on them — option values merge in catalog order, so a `[]` on port 2's `none` would erase the stick port 1 really has. Paddles and a 1351 already have their own facts. The machines whose pads have no option behind them — the Atari, the MEGA65, the NES, the X16 — declare it at machine level, and the PET and the web target declare nothing, out loud.

**`input.controls` is the first fact that is a list**, which needed two things of the compiler. `factProblems` now checks that a catalog's list is an array of real control names and says which one is wrong, because a typo there is a control that silently never projects. And `#fact(input.controls)` is refused by name: there is no literal to fold a list into, and folding one would have handed the IR an array where an integer goes — a miscompile rather than an error. It is `program: false` for the same reason, so it is off `@8bitscript/system` and off a program's sheet; the editor and `8bs targets --json` read it, a program asks its input layer.

The eighteen control names now have an owner. They were spelled out in three places — the compiler had none, the CLI's `controllers.mjs` and the editor's panel had one each. `LOGICAL_CONTROLS` in the compiler is the list a catalog is validated against, and the other two copies are held equal to it by tests: the CLI's directly, the editor's through the same import its own test makes, because the extension has no dependencies at all and can only ever see this as JSON.

**What the editor deleted.** `DEVICE_CONTROLS` and `PAD_KINDS` in `editors/vscode/src/controllerProfile.cjs`. `project()` reads `input.controls` off the resolved fact sheet it was already being handed, and derives the kind from the shapes the toolchain publishes on the `input.controls` fact's own description — which is where a table that is the *vocabulary* belongs, rather than on any one machine's sheet. A toolchain too old to publish the shapes still gets the right controls, only without a name for them; a machine with ports and nothing said about what is in them gets a sentence rather than an invented pad.
